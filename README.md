## Project Overview
Welcome to LanguageLink, a comprehensive project that focuses on both multilingual sentence similarity and language detection! LanguageLink aims to bridge language barriers and enhance the capabilities of various natural language processing applications. Our project includes two core components:

1. **Multilingual Sentence Similarity**: Our model enables you to compare the similarity between sentences in multiple languages. This functionality is particularly useful for cross-lingual understanding and text similarity analysis.

2. **Language Detection**: LanguageLink also provides a robust language detection module that predicts the language of a given sentence. This feature enhances language-agnostic text processing and assists in tasks such as multilingual content analysis and routing.

## Documentation
For a comprehensive understanding of our project, please refer to the _Final Report.pdf_. This document covers:

- **Abstract**: A concise summary of the project's goals and outcomes.
- **Literature Review**: An overview of related work and research in the field of multilingual sentence similarity and language detection.
- **Model Information**: Detailed information about the model architectures, training data, and evaluation metrics for both multilingual sentence similarity and language detection.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project can be downloaded from the [Tatoeba Export](https://downloads.tatoeba.org/exports/sentences.tar.bz2). Please refer to the `readme.txt` files within each folder for a better understanding of the dataset's structure and contents.

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/harsh-sutariya/LanguageLink.git
   cd LanguageLink
   ```

2. Follow the instructions in the _Final Report.pdf_ to set up and train the models for multilingual sentence similarity and language detection.

## Usage
### Multilingual Sentence Similarity
To use the multilingual sentence similarity model, refer to the usage instructions provided in the [Documentation](documentation_link_here).

### Language Detection
For language detection, simply call the relevant function or endpoint as described in the documentation. It will predict the language of the input sentence.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions from the community to improve and expand this project.
